    * ** NOTE:-><br><br>

    1. <b style="color:blue;"> <br>
    Use SupervisorJob when you don't want an exception from a child to cancel the parent or the other children, <br>
    because if a parent fails, then all its children are cancelled. <br><br>

    Supervisor Scope is only used as a parent to run children coroutines,
    and so you can use it as a builder to wrap children coroutines to avoid cancellation of <br>
    children coroutines if one child is cancelled due to an exception thrown. <br>
